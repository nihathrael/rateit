RateIt! is a small tool to rate - among everything - chicks. It was created for users in highly sound-sensitive areas (such as libraries) to have the possibility of sharing their rating in real-time.

Rating Rules
~~~~~~~~
1. A 10 is highest, 5 is lowest rating. Off scale is xD (under 5).
2. When in doubt, always round down.
3. A group is always rated from left to right (from your point of view), near to far.
4. I dare you to rate 10!
